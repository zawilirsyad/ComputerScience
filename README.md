# Algorithm & Flowchart

Individual task: Create an Algorithm & Flowchart

## What are Algorithms & Flowcharts?

An algorithm is a sequence of logical steps arranged systematically to solve a problem or achieve a specific goal. In programming, algorithms define how a task or problem can be solved by a computer with specific and detailed instructions.

A flowchart is a visual diagram that shows the sequence of steps in a process or algorithm. Flowcharts use standard symbols to represent processes graphically, making them easier to understand.

## Task Description

Create an Algorithm and Flowchart for the following problems:

1.     Palindrome Detection
Given a text, check if it is a palindrome or not. For example, the word "Malam", Output = palindrome.

2.     Reverse Words
Given a sentence, reverse the order of words in the sentence. For example, the sentence "I am learning JavaScript", Output = "JavaScript learning am I".
